# Multi-Account Feature Documentation

## Migration from Single Account

If you were using the app before this update:
- Your existing account will be automatically migrated
- It will be named "Default Account"
- All your settings and data remain intact
- You can rename it or add additional accounts

## Technical Details

### Data Storage
- Accounts are stored using **Hive** local database
- Each account has a unique ID based on URL+API key hash
- Active account ID stored in SharedPreferences
- Old SharedPreferences settings are automatically migrated

### Account Structure
```dart
class Account {
  String id;           // Unique identifier
  String name;         // Display name
  String baseUrl;      // Server URL
  String apiKey;       // API key
  bool isActive;       // Current account flag
  DateTime createdAt;  // Creation timestamp
  DateTime lastUsed;   // Last access timestamp
}
```

### Security Considerations
- API keys are stored locally and never transmitted except to their respective servers
- Each account maintains separate authentication
- No cross-account data sharing
- Account switching clears cached data appropriately

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify server URL includes `http://` or `https://`
- Check API key is valid and has proper permissions
- Use "Test Connection" before saving accounts
- Ensure server is accessible from your device

### Account Switching Problems
- Try refreshing the account list
- Check if account credentials are still valid
- Remove and re-add problematic accounts

### Migration Issues
- Old settings should migrate automatically
- If not, manually add your account details
- Previous data and cache will be preserved

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:
- Account sync status indicators
- Quick account switcher widget
- Account-specific settings and preferences
- Import/export account configurations
- Account groups and organization features

## Support

If you encounter issues with the multi-account feature:
1. Check the connection to your Immich server
2. Verify API keys are correct
3. Try removing and re-adding accounts
4. Check server logs for authentication errors
5. Report bugs with detailed logs and steps to reproduce
